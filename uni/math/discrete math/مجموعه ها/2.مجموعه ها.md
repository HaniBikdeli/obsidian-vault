## متمم مجموعه

اگر از مرجع اعضای یک مجموعه را خارج کنیم متمم آن مجموعه بدست می آید.

## Subsets

The set A is a subset of B if and only if every element of A is also an element of B. We use
the notation A ⊆ B to indicate that A is a subset of the set B.

## Power sets

Given a set S, the power set of S is the set of all subsets of the set S. The power set of S is denoted by P (S).

## Cartesian Products

The order of elements in a collection is often important. Because sets are unordered, a different structure is needed to represent ordered collections. This is provided by ordered n-tuples.
The ordered n-tuple (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) is the ordered collection that has a1 as its first element, a2 as its second element, . . . , and an as its nth element.

Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by A × B, is the set of allordered pairs (a, b), where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Hence, 
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B}.

(!) Note that the Cartesian products A × B and B × A are not equal, unless A = ∅ or B = ∅
(so that A × B = ∅) or A = B (see Exercises 31 and 38). This is illustrated in Example 18.
