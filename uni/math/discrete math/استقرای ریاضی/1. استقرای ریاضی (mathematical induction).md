Proofs using mathematical induction have two parts. First, they show that the statement holds for the positive integer 1. Second, they show that if the statement holds for a positive integer then it must also hold for the next larger integer.

Mathematical induction is based on the rule of inference that tells us
that if P (1) and ∀k(P (k) → P (k + 1)) are true for the domain of positive integers, then ∀nP (n)is true

Understanding how to read and construct proofs by mathematical induction is a key goal of learning discrete mathematics.
